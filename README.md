# MERN Blog Web Application

This is a full-stack blog web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Users can browse blog posts, read individual articles, and leave comments. The application also features a recommendation system for related blogs on single blog pages, user authentication (login/signup), essential pages (Home, Blog listing, Contact), and a secure admin panel for content management.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the blog application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm/) (installed with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Community Server)

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following (adjust as needed):

    ```env
    
JWT_TOKEN_SECRET = 7df79b37597f0d6449a922587d564c9ab058105aac1ba5fe174b43ebc4c0f0a51086dafc2407f57ee2f601156c6fa369247450146ca7b87b6c152e578192bc50

JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRY = 1d

PORT = 3000 

MONGODB_ATLAS_USERNAME = shrisantadhikari

MONGODB_ATLAS_PASSWORD = MedevybmorSdpV5A

MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://shrisantadhikari:MedevybmorSdpV5A@cluster0.sod5c.mongodb.net 
    ```

    **Note:** Replace `your_blog_database_name` with your desired MongoDB database name and `your_secret_jwt_key` with a strong, random secret key for JWT.

### Database Setup

1.  **Start your MongoDB server.** You might need to run a command like `mongod` in your terminal depending on your installation.

2.  The backend application will automatically attempt to connect to the MongoDB instance specified in your `.env` file (`MONGO_URI`).

3.  You might need to create an initial admin user through a seed script or manually through a MongoDB client (like MongoDB Compass) depending on how you've implemented the admin panel authentication.

## Running the Application

Open two separate terminal windows.

### Running the Frontend

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will usually open the frontend application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Backend

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Start the backend server:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```

    Using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn server
    ```

    The backend server should start and listen on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `http://localhost:5000`).

## Admin Panel

The admin panel is typically accessible through a specific route (e.g., `/admin`). You will need to log in using the admin credentials configured in your backend. From the admin panel, you can manage blog posts, users, and comments.

## Recommended Blogs Logic

The recommendation system for related blogs on the single blog page likely works based on one or more of the following strategies:

* **Tag/Category Matching:** If blog posts are tagged or categorized, the system recommends posts with similar tags or categories to the currently viewed post.
* **Content Similarity:** The system analyzes the content (title, body) of the current blog post and recommends other posts with similar content, often using techniques like keyword analysis or vector embeddings.
* **Author/Topic Relevance:** Recommending other posts by the same author or within a similar broader topic.

The specific implementation details for the recommendation logic can be found in the backend code, likely within the route handler or service responsible for fetching single blog posts.
